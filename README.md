üìñ About Me
I am a hardworking and passionate individual with a deep interest in solving problems and creating impactful solutions. Currently, I am a sophomore at Principia College, pursuing dual degrees in Computer Science and Economics, with a minor in Mathematics. My academic focus lies at the intersection of technology and finance, where I aim to leverage data-driven insights to drive innovation and efficiency.

I am an active member of the Principia Investment Club, where I analyze technology companies and private equity investments under the guidance of Leander Linsler. I am also involved in the Principia Solar Car project, collaborating with the engineering department to enhance my practical skills in technology and teamwork.
My ultimate goal is to establish a technology company that bridges my interests in computer science, economics, and innovation. I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects that make a difference.
